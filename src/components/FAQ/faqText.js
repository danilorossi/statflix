      This website will give you some fun facts and stats about
      your Netflix viewing activity, based on the activty file you

      I am a software engineer and I work on a variety of side projects to learn
      new technologies and refresh things I used in the past: this specific
       project is an excuse to see how to combine two technology, React and d3js.

      Really, I just do some calculations and show some statistics.
      The file you upload in this page does not contain any sensitive information,
      it's just a list of titles and dates (just the date, no time), you can check
      yourself by opening it with your favourite text editor or as a spreadsheet.
      I do not store any of it and I do not have access to your Netflix credentials:
      once you reload this webpage, it's like you never uploaded it :)

      This is a work in progress pet project, nothing is final, not even the title:
      I hope to improve the page and provide even more interesting insights and
      cool visualizations, but I do not promise anything :)
